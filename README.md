# Blockchain-Enabled Forestry Management System

## Overview
This system leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent, verifiable, and sustainable approach to forestry management. By recording land data, harvesting activities, reforestation efforts, and carbon sequestration on an immutable ledger, we enable more accountable forest stewardship while creating economic opportunities through carbon credits and sustainable timber certification.

## System Architecture
The system consists of four primary smart contracts that work together to manage the entire forestry lifecycle:

### 1. Land Parcel Registration Contract
- Records and maintains details of forest areas with unique identifiers
- Stores geographical boundaries, species composition, age distribution, and health metrics
- Tracks ownership and stewardship responsibilities
- Enables updates to forest characteristics over time via verified data sources
- Integrates with satellite imagery and IoT sensors for real-time monitoring

### 2. Harvesting Permit Contract
- Manages authorizations for sustainable logging operations
- Implements programmable rules for selective harvesting based on scientific forestry principles
- Issues time-bound permits with specific volume and species restrictions
- Requires validation from multiple stakeholders (government, environmental organizations)
- Records harvest activities with timestamps and volumes for traceability

### 3. Reforestation Verification Contract
- Tracks replanting efforts following harvesting or natural disturbances
- Verifies species selection, planting density, and survival rates
- Implements milestone-based verification through satellite imagery and field reports
- Issues compliance certificates for successful reforestation
- Manages incentive distribution for reforestation activities

### 4. Carbon Sequestration Contract
- Measures carbon capture based on forest growth and composition
- Tokenizes carbon credits with unique attributes (location, forest type, age)
- Implements verification protocols for carbon measurement accuracy
- Enables trading of carbon credits on specialized marketplaces
- Prevents double-counting through permanent ledger records

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Stack
- Solidity 0.8.x for core contract logic
- OpenZeppelin libraries for security and standard implementations
- Chainlink oracles for external data verification (satellite imagery, climate data)
- IPFS for storing larger datasets and documentation

### Data Verification
- Multi-source data validation (satellite, drone, ground-based sensors)
- Consensus mechanisms for disputed measurements
- Temporal consistency checks across reporting periods
- Anomaly detection for identifying irregular activities or data

### Governance
- Multi-stakeholder governance model (forest owners, government, NGOs, local communities)
- Transparent voting mechanisms for policy updates
- Dispute resolution protocols for conflicting claims

## User Interactions

### For Forest Owners/Managers
1. Register forest parcels with detailed characteristics
2. Apply for harvesting permits with sustainable harvesting plans
3. Document reforestation activities with supporting evidence
4. Generate and trade carbon credits based on verified sequestration

### For Regulators/Auditors
1. Review and approve harvesting permit applications
2. Verify compliance with reforestation requirements
3. Validate carbon sequestration measurements
4. Access immutable records for enforcement actions

### For Carbon Credit Buyers
1. Browse available carbon credits with detailed provenance
2. Purchase credits with verifiable impact metrics
3. Track the ongoing performance of source forests
4. Demonstrate regulatory compliance or ESG commitments

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites
- Ethereum-compatible blockchain (Ethereum, Polygon, energy-efficient alternatives)
